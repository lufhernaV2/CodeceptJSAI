<h1>CodeceptJS with OpenAI </h1>                                                                                                  

<p>This is a small project using the CodeceptJS testing framework along with Playwright to test a shopping website</p>
<br>
<p>What makes this project unique is that the Codecept Framework has built in BDD, which makes the code much easier to 
understand for those not to tech savy</p>
<br>
<p>CodeceptJS also has a great feature that allows the automated tests to 'self-heal'. This means that it sees failures in the
tests and uses AI to fix the tests without any need for an engineer.</p>
